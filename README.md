# Basic Algorithms
This is a document vault containing some basic programming algorithms written in JavaScript. These self explanatory codes contains console logs that will show the user exactly what is happening in the code. 

As we progress through a programming language, we will get more and more used to the language provided methods for all basic operations. Generally, we developers won't spend time on writing these basic codes from scratch. As a result, we will forget these basic algorithms in the course of time. 
This vault, and the codes within can be used a quick recap to the basics of programming algorithms.

## How to use
You can either download or clone the repo to your local machine and there will be independent files for each algorithm. Open terminal in the root folder of the js file and run the file. `node filename.js`

You can see a well explained execution of the code.

## How to contribute
If you think this vault is incomplete, you can add your algorithm to it. 

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a folder for your category if it doesn't already exist.
3. Create the `.js` file of the algorithm.
4. Create your pull request.

#### Keep in mind:
* The codes must be independent single file.
* Reduce the complexity as much as possible.
* Use console.log at each step of code execution so that users get a clear picture of what's happening.
* Use the name of the algorithm as file name with camelCasing.
* Update the readme content as well.
